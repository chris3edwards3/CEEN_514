SUBJECT: Goals for 514

I am excited to take this class. I have been working in the Hydroinformatics lab since last May, 
but I haven't had a chance to use Tethys yet. Back in May I completed the "Learning Tethys" 
tutorials, but that's it. I have mainly been doing work in ArcGIS and Pycharm.

I want to learn more how all of the aspects of an App fit together. I am excited to learn how to 
use mapping services, visualization techniques, and GIS processes. I also want to learn more
about how data is stored and retrieved on a server.

I am excited about the class because it will give me the opportunity to learn things step by
step. In the lab I have picked up on things here and there, but I don't get the full picture.
